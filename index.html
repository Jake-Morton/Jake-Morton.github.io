            I was born in Puckett, MS and lived there until I was 8 years old and then moved to Brandon, MS where I finished high school with honors. 
            <br><br>
            I went to Hinds Community College for 2 years where I received my associates degree and then 
            transferred to University of Southern Mississippi to continue my education in Construction Management where I will graduate in May of 2022.
            <br><br>
            I have worked in the construction industry for the last 7 years. 
            I have 5 years in commercial construction helping with the process of building a building 
            as well as 2 internships as an assistant superintendent and as an intern Estimator. 
            I also have 2 years of residential construction just so I can see both sides of construction. 
            In residential construction I was a crew leader that was responsible for making sure my crew finish home remodels before the deadline

            The work and services I provide include:
            <br><br>
            Design Build- This is a process in construction that gets rid of any challenges within cost and schedule that allows for a much smoother construction process that makes the project flow smoother and be completed at a quicker rate. 
            <br> <br>
            Construction Management- It can be difficult to have a construction process where there is no coordination or communication between the owner, architect, and construction manager so the company makes it our responsibility to have meetings with the owner as well as the architect to make sure that everyone is on the same page for the construction process to make sure everything is done in an orderly manner and professionally. 
            <br><br>
            General Contracting- As a General contractor the company makes sure that we manage people to be the best they can be so they can be more efficient and effective. When the company completes projects we make sure to do it professionally to make sure that you as an owner would want us back for another project. 
        </p>
